Please check our [our documentation site](https://docs.daily.co/) to get started. If you're building a web app with our daily-js front-end JavaScript library, you may be particularly interested in:

- The [daily-js reference docs](https://docs.daily.co/reference#using-the-dailyco-front-end-library), for help adding video calls to your app
- The [REST API reference docs](https://docs.daily.co/reference), for help creating video call rooms, configuring features for those rooms, and managing users and permissions
